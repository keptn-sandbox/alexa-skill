# Overview

Using an Alexa device or Alexa app on your phone, you can invoke Keptn with a voice command. The Keptn Alexa skill is designed to demonstrate in a fun way the integration to the [Keptn API](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.7.x/reference/api/).

Check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/gR3zAaInvDA) to watch the skill in action.

# Known Limitations
1. Project and service names are hardcoded, so the skill currently supports these deployments:
    * If `deploy carts` is asked to the Alexa skill, then a keptn `new-artifact` event is sent for project: `sockshop` and service: `carts`.  Supported versions are: `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`. 
    * If `deploy simplenode` is asked to the Alexa skill, then a keptn `new-artifact` event is sent for project:`keptnsample` and service: `simplenodeservice`.  Supported versions are: `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`
1. [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is used to store your Keptn credentials. You will be prompted to register your email with Auth0 as part of the installation. The Auth0 account is also managed by the [skill maintainer](#Maintainer) so you will need to contact him to adjust your Keptn settings if there is problems.
1. No connection to the [Keptn Alexa notification service](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/alexa-notification-service)

# Supported Commands

The skill currently supports the following commands. Once you have the skill enabled and configured you can trigger these by saying `Alexa, ask captain seven <command>` so for example to learn about keptn you could say `"Alexa ask captain seven describe"`

| Command | Command_Purpose | Command_Variations | Notes |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Launch | This is a default command which is triggered when you launch the skill. | >`Launch captain seven` >`captain seven` |  The launch command doesn't require account linking but it will give different output depending on if it is enabled or not and if you have already called configure or not. This is an interactive command and at the end will reprompt the user for a further command. As the skill is already active you do not need the skill invocation name for the follow up, you can simply say any command such as `Describe` |
| Describe | Give an overview of what keptn is | >`Describe` >`Describe captain` >`What is captain` | The describe command can be run without account linking. It is non interactive and no additional information needs to be supplied |
| Projects | List the number of projects and their names | >`Project` >`Projects` >`Project details` >`List my projects` >`What are my projects` | The projects command requires account linking. If you have not enabled account linking it will inform you of this. It is non interactive and no additional information needs to be supplied |
| Deploy | Deploy a new version | >`Deploy` >`Deploy version {version} to {service}` or >`Deploy {service} version {version}` | The Deploy command requires account linking. If you have not enabled account linking it will inform you of this. This is an interactive command as you need to specify the service name and version you want to deploy. For example `Deploy carts version 2`. Please note this command only supports carts and simplenode. The project and service names are also hard coded so for carts it must be sockshop, carts and for simple node it must be keptnsample and simplenode. |

7. This will launch the connection to the keptn auth0 account which is where your keptn details will be stored. You need to sign up for this so click on `Sign Up` then enter an email and password to use. 

    **DO NOT use the sign up with google option.**

8. Input your email address \(this can be any address and doesn't have to be the same one as you Alexa account\), a password, your [Keptn API endpoint](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.7.x/reference/api/) \(without http\(s\):\/\/ and trailing \/\) and your [decoded keptn API token](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.7.x/operate/api_token/#retrieve-api-token).

    Authorize the App by clicking on `Accept`

9. Your skill should now be successfully setup and you can use it. Launch the skill by saying `"Alexa launch captain seven"`. The first time you launch it the skill needs to reach out to auth0 to get your keptn details, this is done automatically by saying `configure` but don't worry the skill will talk you through that.
