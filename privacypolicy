This privacy policy describes how keptn (“keptn”, “us” or “we”) protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using our Alexa Skills (“our skills”), please read this policy and our Alexa Skills Terms of Use, as well as the Alexa Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, “Amazon”).

Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.

If you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.

General
When you use the keptn skill you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and an Alexa hosted lambda function is used to decide what the skill should do. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer.

Data
If you wish to trigger deployments or access details on your keptn cluster you must enable account linking with Auth0. We use Auth0 to store your keptn endpoint and token. It is recommended that this is only used for demos and production deployments are not connected to this skill.

To improve our services we analyze automatically how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.

Changes
Our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
